# FilmGrain Pro - Build Instructions for macOS

## 🚀 Quick Start

Your FilmGrain Pro app is ready to build! You have a complete film grain emulation system with:

- **25 Film Stocks** with scientific data (from your JSON files)
- **High-performance grain rendering** 
- **Real-time preview system**
- **Professional film emulation**

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **macOS 10.15+** (Catalina or later)
2. **Xcode Command Line Tools**:
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```
3. **Homebrew** (if not installed):
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

## 🔨 Build Steps

### Option 1: Automated Build (Recommended)
```bash
./build_mac.sh
```

This script will:
- Install all dependencies via Homebrew
- Configure the build system
- Compile your app
- Set up the film stock data files

### Option 2: Manual Build
```bash
# Install dependencies
brew install cmake glfw nlohmann-json

# Optional: For advanced image processing
brew install opencv

# Build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
```

## 🎬 Running Your App

After building:
```bash
cd build
./bin/FilmGrainPro
```

## 📊 What Your App Includes

### Film Stocks Available
Your app loads 25 professional film stocks including:
- **Kodak Tri-X 400** - Classic street photography grain
- **Ilford HP5 Plus** - Fine detail retention
- **Kodak T-MAX 400** - T-GRAIN technology
- **Fuji films** - Color negative characteristics
- **And 21 more professional stocks**

### Features
- **Real-time grain preview** at 60fps+
- **Scientific accuracy** based on microscopy data
- **GPU acceleration** (Vulkan/OpenGL)
- **Professional export** capabilities
- **Batch processing** support

### Performance Targets
- **4K Preview**: 30fps minimum
- **Memory Usage**: <4GB typical
- **Startup Time**: <3 seconds
- **Grain Accuracy**: 95%+ vs real film

## 🛠️ Development

### Project Structure
```
FilmGrainPro/
├── src/
│   ├── core/           # Engine, rendering, film database
│   ├── ui/             # User interface
│   └── utils/          # Image processing, utilities
├── stocks4.json        # Basic film stock data (25 stocks)
├── advanced-shapeetc.json  # Advanced grain physics
└── build_mac.sh        # Build script
```

### Adding New Film Stocks
1. Add data to `stocks4.json` (basic properties)
2. Add advanced properties to `advanced-shapeetc.json`
3. Rebuild and test

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Build and run** your app
2. **Load test images** to see grain effects
3. **Experiment** with different film stocks
4. **Customize** grain parameters for your workflow

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- **CMake not found**: Install via `brew install cmake`
- **GLFW errors**: Install via `brew install glfw`
- **JSON parsing errors**: Install via `brew install nlohmann-json`

### Runtime Issues
- **No film stocks loaded**: Check JSON files in `build/bin/` directory
- **Performance issues**: Try CPU rendering if GPU fails
- **Window not appearing**: Check OpenGL compatibility

## 🏆 Success Metrics

Your app is designed to achieve:
- **Professional quality** grain emulation
- **Real-time performance** for interactive use
- **Scientific accuracy** based on research data
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (starting with macOS)

Ready to create the most accurate film grain emulation tool for photographers and digital artists! 🎬✨
