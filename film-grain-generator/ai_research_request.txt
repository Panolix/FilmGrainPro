AI RESEARCH REQUEST: Film Stock Grain Variation Coefficients

I need detailed technical data for the following 35 film stocks to improve a film grain simulation. For each film stock, please research and provide:

1. **Size Variation Coefficient** (0.0-2.0): How much individual grain sizes vary within the film
   - 0.0 = all grains identical size
   - 0.5 = moderate variation (typical)
   - 1.0+ = high variation (older/faster films)

2. **Opacity Variation Coefficient** (0.0-1.5): How much individual grain opacity varies
   - 0.0 = all grains same opacity
   - 0.6 = moderate variation (typical)
   - 1.0+ = high variation (contrasty films)

Please research technical specifications, manufacturer data sheets, photographic literature, and film development resources.

CONTEXT:
- T-grain films (T-Max) typically have lower size variation (0.3-0.5)
- Traditional cubic grain films (Tri-X) have higher variation (0.7-1.2)
- Fine grain films (Pan F, Ektar) have lower opacity variation (0.4-0.6)
- Fast films (Delta 3200, Natura 1600) have higher variation (0.8-1.2)
- Color negative films typically have moderate variation (0.5-0.8)
- Slide films often have tighter variation (0.4-0.7)

Please provide technical reasoning for each coefficient based on the film's grain structure, emulsion technology, and intended use.
