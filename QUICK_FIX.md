# ðŸ”§ Quick Fix for FilmGrain Pro Build Issue

## Problem
The C++ standard library headers (`<iostream>`, `<vector>`, etc.) are not being found during compilation.

## Solution

### Option 1: Reinstall Xcode Command Line Tools
```bash
# Remove existing tools
sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools

# Reinstall
sudo xcode-select --install
```

### Option 2: Install Full Xcode (Recommended)
1. Open App Store
2. Search for "Xcode"
3. Install Xcode (this will take a while - it's ~15GB)
4. Open Xcode once to accept license
5. Run: `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`

### Option 3: Quick Test Build
Try building a simple test first:
```bash
echo '#include <iostream>
int main() { std::cout << "Hello World!"; return 0; }' > test.cpp
clang++ -std=c++20 test.cpp -o test
./test
```
