   - Color variation within grains (±5%, ±10%, etc.)
   - Brightness variation per grain particle
   - Blend mode recommendations (multiply, overlay, soft light, etc.)
   - Grain randomness vs pattern (how random should placement be)

5. FILM-SPECIFIC TRAITS:
   - What makes this film's grain unique?
   - How does grain change with push/pull processing?
   - Distinctive visual characteristics
   - Comparison to similar films

8. FILM INFORMATION PANEL DATA:

   - Famous photographers who used this film
   - Ideal shooting conditions (bright light, low light, mixed lighting)
   - Processing recommendations (normal, push 1 stop, etc.)
   - Film era/availability (vintage, current production, discontinued)
   - Price point category (budget, mid-range, premium)
   - Alternative films with similar characteristics

6. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
   - Crystal structure (silver halide, T-grain, etc.)
   - Emulsion layers (single, multiple)
   - Processing chemistry effects on grain
   - ISO performance and grain relationship
   - Halation characteristics (glow around bright areas)
   - Cross-processing effects on grain (if applicable)
   - Age/storage effects on grain appearance
   - Scanner/digitization artifacts to avoid or include

7. COLOR & APPEARANCE DETAILS:
   - Exact RGB values for typical grain particles
   - Color temperature bias of grain

FOCUS ON ACCURACY & USABILITY:
- Data should be realistic but practical for digital simulation
- Grain counts should be visible but not overwhelming (100-2000 grains per 1024px)
- Opacity values should work for overlay use (not too subtle, not too heavy)
- Include enough variation between films to make differences noticeable
- Consider both technical accuracy and visual authenticity

GOAL:
Create film grain overlays that photographers and designers would recognize as authentic representations of these specific film stocks, suitable for professional design work and photo editing.
