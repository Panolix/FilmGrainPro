REQUEST FOR REALISTIC FUJIFILM GRAIN SIMULATION DATA

I need detailed technical data for simulating realistic film grain for these specific Fujifilm stocks that are already in my digital application. Please provide data in JSON format for accurate grain generation.

FUJIFILM STOCKS TO ANALYZE (from my current app):

Black & White:
- Fuji Acros 100
- Fuji Acros II 100  
- Fuji Neopan 400
- Fuji Neopan 1600

Color Negative:
- Fuji Pro 400H
- Fuji Pro 160S
- Fuji Superia 400
- Fuji C200
- Fuji Natura 1600

Color Slide/Reversal:
- Fuji Velvia 50
- Fuji Velvia 100
- Fuji Provia 100F
- Fuji Provia 400X

DATA NEEDED FOR EACH STOCK:

1. GRAIN SIZE & DENSITY:
   - Typical grain size in micrometers (Î¼m)
   - Approximate number of visible grains per square millimeter
   - How these specific Fuji stocks compare to each other

2. VISUAL CHARACTERISTICS:
   - Grain shape description (round, irregular, elongated, etc.)
   - Edge characteristics (sharp, soft, fuzzy)
   - Opacity/visibility range (how prominent is the grain?)
   - Color characteristics specific to each Fuji stock

3. FUJIFILM-SPECIFIC TRAITS:
   - What makes each of these Fuji stocks unique in grain character?
   - How does Fuji's emulsion technology affect grain appearance?
   - Differences between Fuji's B&W, color negative, and slide films

4. DIGITAL SIMULATION PARAMETERS:
   - For a 1024x1024 pixel image, how many grain particles should be visible for each stock?
   - What pixel size range for grain at standard web resolution?
   - Recommended opacity ranges for realistic overlay use

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Please structure as JSON with this format for each of the 13 Fuji stocks listed above:

{
  "Fuji Pro 400H": {
    "grain_size_um": [min, max, average],
    "density_per_mm2": number,
    "grain_shape": "description",
    "edge_type": "sharp/soft/fuzzy",
    "opacity_range": [min, max],
    "color_cast": "neutral/warm/cool",
    "clustering": "none/light/moderate/heavy",
    "distinctive_traits": ["trait1", "trait2"],
    "digital_simulation": {
      "grains_per_1024px": number,
      "pixel_size_range": [min, max],
      "recommended_opacity": [min, max]
    }
  }
}

FOCUS ON ACCURACY:
I want to create realistic film grain overlays that actually look like these specific Fujifilm stocks, especially focusing on what makes Fuji grain different from Kodak or Ilford.
