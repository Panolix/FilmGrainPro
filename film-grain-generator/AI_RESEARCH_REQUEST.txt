FILM GRAIN SIMULATION DATA RESEARCH REQUEST
==========================================

OBJECTIVE:

     * Color slide films (Kodak Ektachrome, Fuji Velvia)
     * Black & white films converted to color
   - Dye coupling efficiency data
   
   Sources to check:
   - Color science technical papers
   - Film manufacturer technical datasheets
   - Color reproduction research papers

2. FILM AGING AND STORAGE EFFECTS
   Research needed:
   - How grain characteristics change with film age (0-10 years)
   - Storage temperature effects on grain (freezer vs room temperature)
   - Humidity exposure effects on grain structure
   - Expiration date vs actual usability data
   
   Sources to check:
   - Film preservation research
   - Photography forums with aged film tests
   - Kodak/Fuji storage recommendations

3. ENHANCED CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS
   Research needed:
   - Fractal dimension values for different film stocks
   - Clustering patterns in high-speed vs low-speed films
   - Mathematical models for realistic grain distribution
   - Spatial correlation coefficients for major film stocks
   
   Sources to check:
   - Image processing research papers
   - Microscopic analysis of film grain

DATA FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
========================

Please provide data in JSON-compatible format when possible:

{
  "film_stock_name": {
    "color_crossover": {
      "red_to_green": 0.08,
      "red_to_blue": 0.05,
      "green_to_red": 0.12,
      "green_to_blue": 0.15,
      "blue_to_red": 0.03,
      "blue_to_green": 0.06
    },
    "aging_effects": {
      "grain_increase_per_year": 0.1,
      "contrast_loss_per_year": 0.05,
      "storage_temp_factor": 0.02
    },
    "clustering_data": {
      "fractal_dimension": 1.4,
      "spatial_correlation": 0.25,
      "cluster_probability": 0.15
    }
  }
}

PRIORITY ORDER:
==============
1. Color crossover coefficients (medium impact, easy implementation)
2. Film aging data (interesting for vintage effects)
3. Enhanced clustering algorithms (subtle but authentic)

PERFORMANCE CONSTRAINTS:
=======================
- All effects must add <20% to current rendering time
- No complex physics simulations
- Focus on lookup tables and simple mathematical operations
- Avoid anything requiring iterative calculations or complex algorithms

VALIDATION SOURCES:
==================
Please prioritize data from:
1. Official manufacturer technical publications
2. Peer-reviewed scientific papers
3. Professional photography technical resources
4. Verified darkroom testing results
5. Reputable photography forums with documented tests

AVOID:
======
- Subjective opinions without data
- Unverified forum posts
- Marketing materials without technical specs
- Theoretical models without real-world validation

DELIVERABLE:
===========
Comprehensive technical data package that can be directly implemented into film grain simulation software, with source citations for verification.
